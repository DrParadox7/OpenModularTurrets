OpenModularTurrets
==================

Repo for OpenModularTurrets for Minecraft. It adds modular turrets that can be used to defend your base from players and mobs. This mod should be fairly well documented ingame, if you need any more help, ask us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XjyBTQ9).  

Creating issue tickets:
=======================

If a you create a new issue that: 

1. Duplicates a previous ticket's issue(s) OR 
2. Is unreadable (grammatically or otherwise) OR
3. Does not make sense (Logically or otherwise) OR
4. Is a crash issue without a proper stack trace OR
5. Is new functionality request (New content, CR or otherwise)

the ticket may not be considered and be closed immediately. Make absolutely sure that the ticket you post adheres to the above.

Additionally, for mod compatability request we have 2 requirements:

1. The mod we should do compatability for should not be inactive
2. It should be possible to contact one of the authors directly (from dev to dev)
