OpenModularTurrets
==================

Repo for OpenModularTurrets for Minecraft. It adds modular turrets, walls and fences that can be used to defend your base from players and mobs. This mod supports the ingame wiki mod (IGWMod) from Minemaarten and has most information available through it so we recommend to use that one.  
  
Dev-Builds are available here (be careful, those are experimental and can break your save): [Click here](https://www.ironhide.de/jenkins/job/OpenModularTurrets/)
